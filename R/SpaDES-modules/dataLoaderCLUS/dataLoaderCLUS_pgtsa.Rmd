title: "Database creation for Prince George TSA Analyses Version 1.0"
author: "Kyle Lochhead"
date: "8 June 2020"
output: pdf_document

# Overview

The dataloaderCLUS preps the database and other objects required to run CLUS. A SQLite database is stored in memory called clusdb. This database can be saved to file using `save_clusdb = TRUE` or an existing clusdb can be used by specifying the path with `useCLUSdb = ".../clusdb.sqlite"`.

Here I set the parameters to create a database for the [Prince George timber supply area (TSA)](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/timber-supply-review-and-allowable-annual-cut/allowable-annual-cut-timber-supply-areas/prince-george-tsa). The TSA isin British Columbiaâ€™s north-central interior and covers about 7.97 million hectares. The current AAC (October 11, 2017) is set at 8,350,000 cubic metres per year for the first five years, and
7,350,000 cubic metres for the following five years. Given its size the TSA is divided into [eight supply blocks](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/forestry/stewardship/forest-analysis-inventory/tsr-annual-allowable-cut/map_prince_george_tsa.pdf) with a maxmimum of 1.6 M m3 coming from supply blocks A&B and a maximum of 6.1 million cubic metres per year is attributed to the remaining supply
blocks (and reduced to 5. 1 million cubic metres in October 2022), of which 62,000 cubic
metres per year is attributed to deciduous-leading stands. A maximum of 750,000 cubic metres per year is attributed to bioenergy stands. Given the spatial partitions *** the Prince George TSA will have two seperate databases called pg and pg_north (representing supply blocks A&B)***.

For pg the TSA overlaps with the George Mountain, Narrow Lake, Hart Ranges, Tweedsmuir, Itchas-Ilgachuz, Kennedy Siding, North Cariboo, Red Rock Praire Creek, caribou herds (a combination of DU9, 8 and 7). While for pg_north the TSA overlaps with Takla, Wolverine, Chase, Thutade, and Spatsizi, caribou herds.

# Dependendices

First need an area of interest.
+nameBoundaryFile <- the vector data of the areas to consider. Defaults to caribou herd boundaries.
+nameBoundary<-The specific area of interest
+nameBoundaryColumn<-The column in the nameBoundaryFile that support the query for the area of interest
+nameBoundaryGeom<-the geometry column from which to run the spatial query containing the area of interest

The remaining files are:
+nameCompartmentRaster<- a provincial raster of compartments -- also known as supply blocks. Defaults to 1 compartment
+nameZoneRaster<-a provincial raster of management zones. Defaluts to 1 zone
+nameYieldRaster<-a provincial raster of id's that support a look up to yield tables. Defaults to 1 yield table
+nameAgeRaster<- a provincial raster of age. This can be set to zero, if correctly used to look up yields and constraints. Defaults to an age of 120
+nameCrownClosureRaster<- a provincial raster of crown closure. Used for management constraints. Defaults to 0 crown closure
+nameMaskHarvestLandbaseRaster<- a provincial raster of the timber harvesting landbase (THLB) that delinates area feasible to harvest timber. Defaults to all of the area of interest being eligible for harvesting.

# Events

The module only has an inititialization event for connecting to a database and establishing database objects


## Output data

The outputs contain the database connection object, functions needed to generate queries and the boundary and bounding box of the boundary needed for other queries

# Links to other modules
