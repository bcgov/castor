# Overview

The dataloaderCLUS preps the database connectivitiy and other objects required to run CLUS. A SQLite database is stored in memory called clusdb. This database can be saved to file using `save_clusdb = TRUE` or an existing clusdb can be used by specifying the path with `useCLUSdb = ".../clusdb.sqlite"`


# Usage

```{r module_usage}
library(SpaDES)
library(velox)
library(SpaDES.core)
library(data.table)

# Dependendices

First need an area of interest.
+nameBoundaryFile <- the vector data of the areas to consider. Defaults to caribou herd boundaries.
+nameBoundary<-The specific area of interest
+nameBoundaryColumn<-The column in the nameBoundaryFile that support the query for the area of interest
+nameBoundaryGeom<-the geometry column from which to run the spatial query containing the area of interest

The remaining files are:
+nameCompartmentRaster<- a provincial raster of compartments -- also known as supply blocks. Defaults to 1 compartment
+nameZoneRaster<-a provincial raster of management zones. Defaluts to 1 zone
+nameYieldRaster<-a provincial raster of id's that support a look up to yield tables. Defaults to 1 yield table
+nameAgeRaster<- a provincial raster of age. This can be set to zero, if correctly used to look up yields and constraints. Defaults to an age of 120
+nameCrownClosureRaster<- a provincial raster of crown closure. Used for management constraints. Defaults to 0 crown closure
+nameMaskHarvestLandbaseRaster<- a provincial raster of the timber harvesting landbase (THLB) that delinates area feasible to harvest timber. Defaults to all of the area of interest being eligible for harvesting.

# Events

The module only has an inititialization event for connecting to a database and establishing database objects


## Output data

The outputs contain the database connection object, functions needed to generate queries and the boundary and bounding box of the boundary needed for other queries

# Links to other modules

Links to every module required by CLUS
