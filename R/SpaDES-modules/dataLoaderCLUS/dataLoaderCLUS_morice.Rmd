# Overview

The dataloaderCLUS preps the database and other objects required to run CLUS. A SQLite database is stored in memory called clusdb. This database can be saved to file using `save_clusdb = TRUE` or an existing clusdb can be used by specifying the path with `useCLUSdb = ".../clusdb.sqlite"`.

Here I set the parameters to create a database for the [Morice timber supply area (TSA)](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/timber-supply-review-and-allowable-annual-cut/allowable-annual-cut-timber-supply-areas/morice-tsa). The TSA is located in northern-central British Columbia and is on the western edge of BC's central interior plateau. The Morice TSA encompasses approximately 1.5 million hectares of land. In March 16, 2015 the allowable annual cut was set at 1.9 million cubic metres, partitioned between 1.6 million cubic metres of live tree volume and  300 000 cubic metres of dead volume. On March 16, 2020 the AAC was kept at 2015 values until a new AAC is determined. 

Three herds overlap with the Morice TSA - Takla, Telkwa, and Tweedsmuir.Thus for building the database only information on these three herds is needed.

How was this determined?
(A minimum harvest volume criterion of 140 cubic metres per hectare was applied in the base case.)

# Dependendices

First need an area of interest.
+nameBoundaryFile <- the vector data of the areas to consider. Defaults to caribou herd boundaries.
+nameBoundary<-The specific area of interest
+nameBoundaryColumn<-The column in the nameBoundaryFile that support the query for the area of interest
+nameBoundaryGeom<-the geometry column from which to run the spatial query containing the area of interest

The remaining files are:
+nameCompartmentRaster<- a provincial raster of compartments -- also known as supply blocks. Defaults to 1 compartment
+nameZoneRaster<-a provincial raster of management zones. Defaluts to 1 zone
+nameYieldRaster<-a provincial raster of id's that support a look up to yield tables. Defaults to 1 yield table
+nameAgeRaster<- a provincial raster of age. This can be set to zero, if correctly used to look up yields and constraints. Defaults to an age of 120
+nameCrownClosureRaster<- a provincial raster of crown closure. Used for management constraints. Defaults to 0 crown closure
+nameMaskHarvestLandbaseRaster<- a provincial raster of the timber harvesting landbase (THLB) that delinates area feasible to harvest timber. Defaults to all of the area of interest being eligible for harvesting.

# Events

The module only has an inititialization event for connecting to a database and establishing database objects


## Output data

The outputs contain the database connection object, functions needed to generate queries and the boundary and bounding box of the boundary needed for other queries

# Links to other modules

Links to every module required by CLUS
