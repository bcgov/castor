# Overview

The dataCastor preps the database connectivity and other objects required to run Castor. A SQLite database is stored in memory called castordb. This database can be saved to file using `saveCastorDB = TRUE` or an existing castordb can be used by specifying the path with `useCastorDB = ".../_castordb.sqlite"`


# Usage

```{r module_usage}
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
source(here::here("R/functions/R_Postgres.R"))

paths <- list(
  modulePath = paste0(here::here(),"/R/SpaDES-modules"),
  outputPath = paste0(here::here(),"/R/SpaDES-modules/dataCastor")
)

times <- list(start = 0, end = 0)
parameters <-  list(
  .progress = list(type = NA, interval = NA),
  .globals = list(),
  dataCastor = list(saveCastorDB = TRUE,
                    sqlite_dbname = 'simple',
                    randomLandscapeZoneNumber = 1,
                    randomLandscape = list(100,100,0, 100, 0, 100),
                    randomLandscapeZoneConstraint = data.table(zoneid = 1,  variable = 'age', threshold = 140, type = 'ge', percentage = 0)
                    )
  )

                       data.table(zoneid = 1,  variable = 'age', threshold = 140, type = 'ge', percentage = 0),

                       data.table(zoneid = 5,  variable = 'age', threshold = 140, type = 'ge', percentage = 0),
                       data.table(zoneid = 6,  variable = 'age', threshold = 140, type = 'ge', percentage = 0),
                       data.table(zoneid = 7,  variable = 'age', threshold = 140, type = 'ge', percentage = 0),

                       data.table(zoneid = 10, variable = 'age', threshold = 140, type = 'ge', percentage = 0)
                     ))

# Dependendices

First need an area of interest.
+nameBoundaryFile <- the vector data of the areas to consider. Defaults to caribou herd boundaries.
+nameBoundary<-The specific area of interest
+nameBoundaryColumn<-The column in the nameBoundaryFile that support the query for the area of interest
+nameBoundaryGeom<-the geometry column from which to run the spatial query containing the area of interest

The remaining files are:
+nameCompartmentRaster<- a provincial raster of compartments -- also known as supply blocks. Defaults to 1 compartment
+nameZoneRaster<-a provincial raster of management zones. Defaluts to 1 zone
+nameYieldRaster<-a provincial raster of id's that support a look up to yield tables. Defaults to 1 yield table
+nameAgeRaster<- a provincial raster of age. This can be set to zero, if correctly used to look up yields and constraints. Defaults to an age of 120
+nameCrownClosureRaster<- a provincial raster of crown closure. Used for management constraints. Defaults to 0 crown closure
+nameMaskHarvestLandbaseRaster<- a provincial raster of the timber harvesting landbase (THLB) that delinates area feasible to harvest timber. Defaults to all of the area of interest being eligible for harvesting.

# Events

The module only has an inititialization event for connecting to a database and establishing database objects


## Output data

The outputs contain the database connection object, functions needed to generate queries and the boundary and bounding box of the boundary needed for other queries

# Links to other modules

Links to every module required by Castor
