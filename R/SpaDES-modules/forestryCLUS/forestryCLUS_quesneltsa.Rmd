# Overview

This module provides the logic for simulating forestry decisions on the landscape. These decisions currently involve spatializing the harvest flow objectives which include: where, when and how much to harvest. These factors help determine policies related to harvest flows, opening size, seral distrubitions, road densitites, preservation areas, silvicultural systems, etc. More sophistication to these decisions would involve looking at the costs and benefits beyond the current time period; this requires optimization or improved heuristics -- which may be considered in the future. The general overview of forestryCLUS follows.

At each time step, harvest units (pixels or blocks) are ranked according to a priority (e.g., oldest first), this constructs a queue. This queue of harvest units are then subject to various constraints meant to meet objectives for the study area. Harvest units are harvested until either a constraint is binding, the queue is exhausted or the harvest flow is met. Next, the age of the forest is advanced to the next time period and the process is repeated. 

During the simulation various reports and information surrounding each pixel can be saved/recorded or used in a summary. Note these outputs are considered expected future outcomes given the inputs developed by the anlayst.For a historical selection of harvesting activities see [cutblockSeqPrepCLUS](https://github.com/bcgov/clus/tree/master/R/SpaDES-modules/cutblockSeqPrepCLUS). Both  cutblockSeqPrepCLUS and forestryCLUS build a list of landing locations through simulation time. One is historical while the other is one possible future realization.

# Usage
This module could be a parent module?? It relies on: 
1. dataloadCLUS (set up the clusdb) 
2. blockingCLUS (preforms the pixel aggregation into harvest units)
3. growingStockCLUS (increments the age and volume in pixels)
4. (Optionally) rsfCLUS (track resource selection functions)
5. (Optionally) roadCLUS (preforms the access to the harvest units)
6. uploaderCLUS (uploades the outputs to a shiny app)


# Quesnel TSA Scenarios
business as usual (BAU); no new constraints, caribou or otherwise; establishes the current 'baseline' or benchmark to evaluate the potential impact of 'new' actions in caribou habitat

no harvest in Chilcotin herds critical habtiat; to support Chilcotin herd planning, we run a sceanrio with no harvest in the  Chilcotin (Tweeds/Itchas/Rainbow/Charlotte Alplands) HEWSR and Matrix; harvest is BAU in other herds; assesses the potential maximum impact of protecting Central Selkirks only, assuming other herds unprotected

"ECCC" in Chilcotin caribou critical habtiat; an alternative to a no harvest scenario, attemps to interpret the federal recovery strategy that stipulates no disturbance in high and low elevation critical habitat, and up to 35% disturbance in matrix habtiat; this is a possible scenario if Canada were to enact an emergency order on Chilcotin only

no harvest in caribou critical habtait areas; where there is cirtical habitat, no harvest in any types (including matrix); establishes the 'maximum impact' that protection of caribou habitat might potentially have on forest harvest; in Quesnel these include Tweedsmuir LEWR, Tweedsmuir Matrix, Itcha-Ilgachuz HEWSR, Itcha-Ilgachuz LEWR, Itcha-Ilgachuz LESR, Itcha-Ilgachuz Matrix, Barkerville HEWSR, Barkerville Matrix, Narrow Lake Matrix, North Cariboo HEWSR, North Cariboo Matrix, Wells Gray North HEWSR, Wells Gray North Matrix

'ECCC' in caribou critical habtait areas; an alternative to a no harvest scenario, attemps to interpret the federal recovery strategy that stipulates no disturbance in high and low eleavtion cirtcial habitat, and up to 35% disturabnce in matrix habtiat; this is a possible scenario if Canada were to enact an emergency order; assumes all herds protected

## 'harvestPriority' parameter 
- focus on minimizzing 'disturabnce; for cariobu, then older, higher vlomue stands
  - 'dist, age DESC, vol DESC' priortize based on:
      - 'dist', i.e., distance to disturbed pixel (closest first), then
      - 'age DESC', i.e., descending age (oldest first), then
      - 'vol DESC', i.e., descending volume (highest volume first)

## 'harvestFlow'
from 2016 analysis report:  maximum even flow harvest was 2,139,000m^3^/year; from detemrination, June 6, 2017, the  AAC was set at 2,607,000 cubic metres 

- First, I tested a harvest flow of 2,139,00m^3^/year but this was too high so I tried 2,000,000, then 2,800,000 and finally settled on 1,700,000 which worked.


why was this model max even flow at 79% of previosu model? maybe adjacney?, maybe min. volume? or maybe harvest queue? It says in the discussion paper that they expect the average age of harvest to decline. In particular in 50 yrs from now they forcast stands of 50 yrs or older to contribute ~57% of the harvest. Possibly I should have changed the age constraint to reflect this.

- I used 150 m3/ha as minimum harvest volume

For cutblock adjacency, I used 3 m adjacncey

## Flow Chart

```{r, flow_chart}
library(SpaDES.core)
eventDiagram(mysimout)
```

## Algorithm

The general algorithm (pseudo-code) follows as:

`compartment_list`= SELECT zones FROM compartments WHERE target > 0 ORDER BY priority_compartment

FOR compartment_selected in `compartment_list`
`queue`<- SELECT pixelid, blockid FROM pixels WHERE 
            compartment = compartment_selected AND thlb > 0 AND constraint = 0                 ORDER BY priority
               
IF (`queue` > 0 )
  check constraints
ELSE 
  NEXT
        

# Data dependencies

## Input data

A SQLite db is required (output from dataloaderCLUS). A harvestFlow data.table object that includes the forest management unit (i.e., compartment, aka - 'supply block'), the partition from which the harvest flow applies (e.x., All dead pine); the year at which the flow applies and the amount of volume.

## Output data

A list of landings || blocks from when they are harvested.

# Links to other modules

dataloaderCLUS is required.
