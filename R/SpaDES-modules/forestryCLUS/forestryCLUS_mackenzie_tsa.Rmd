# Overview

This module provides the logic for simulating forestry decisions on the landscape. These decisions currently involve spatializing the harvest flow objectives which include: where, when and how much to harvest. These factors help determine policies related to harvest flows, opening size, seral distrubitions, road densitites, preservation areas, silvicultural systems, etc. More sophistication to these decisions would involve looking at the costs and benefits beyond the current time period; this requires optimization or improved heuristics -- which may be considered in the future. The general overview of forestryCLUS follows.

At each time step, harvest units (pixels or blocks) are ranked according to a priority (e.g., oldest first), this constructs a queue. This queue of harvest units are then subject to various constraints meant to meet objectives for the study area. Harvest units are harvested until either a constraint is binding, the queue is exhausted or the harvest flow is met. Next, the age of the forest is advanced to the next time period and the process is repeated. 

During the simulation various reports and information surrounding each pixel can be saved/recorded or used in a summary. Note these outputs are considered expected future outcomes given the inputs developed by the anlayst.For a historical selection of harvesting activities see [cutblockSeqPrepCLUS](https://github.com/bcgov/clus/tree/master/R/SpaDES-modules/cutblockSeqPrepCLUS). Both  cutblockSeqPrepCLUS and forestryCLUS build a list of landing locations through simulation time. One is historical while the other is one possible future realization.

# Usage
This module could be a parent module?? It relies on: 
1. dataloadCLUS (set up the clusdb) 
2. blockingCLUS (preforms the pixel aggregation into harvest units)
3. growingStockCLUS (increments the age and volume in pixels)
4. (Optionally) rsfCLUS (track resource selection functions)
5. (Optionally) roadCLUS (preforms the access to the harvest units)
6. uploaderCLUS (uploades the outputs to a shiny app)


# Mackenzie TSA Scenarios
business as usual (BAU); no new constraints, caribou or otherwise; establishes the current 'baseline' or benchmark to evaluate the potential impact of 'new' actions in caribou habitat

no harvest in Central Group caribou critical habtiat; to support Central groups  planning, we run a sceanrio with no harvest in the  Central Group HEWSR, LEWSR and Matrix; harvest is BAU in other herds; assesses the potential maximum impact of protecting Central groups only, assuming other herds unprotected

"ECCC" in Central groups caribou critical habtiat; an alternative to a no harvest scenario, attemps to interpret the federal recovery strategy that stipulates no disturbance in high and low elevation critical habitat, and up to 35% disturbance in matrix habtiat; this is a possible scenario if Canada were to enact an emergency order on Central group only

Partnership Agreement Scenario; BC, West Moberly First Nation, Saulteau First Nation and Canada have an agreement to protect certain areas in the central group; No harvest in Central group partnership agreement areas A2, B2, and B3, maximum 35%  disturbance (15%) harvest in  Central group partnership agreement areas A1, B1, B4 and B5.

No harvest in all Partnership Agreement areas; this scenario assesses the potential maximum impact of protecting all the partnership agreement areas, assuming other herds unprotected

no harvest in southern mountain caribou critical habtait areas; where there is cirtical habitat, no harvest in any types (including matrix); establishes the 'maximum impact' that protection of caribou critical habitat might potentially have on forest harvest; in Mackenzie TSA these include: Kennedy Siding HEWSR, Kennedy Siding HESR, Kennedy Siding HEWR, Kennedy Siding LEWR, Kennedy Siding Matrix, Moberly HEWR, Moberly HEWSR, Moberly HESR, Moberly Matrix, Graham HESR, Graham HEWSR, Graham Matrix

'ECCC' in caribou critical habtait areas; an alternative to a no harvest scenario, attemps to interpret the federal recovery strategy that stipulates no disturbance in high and low eleavtion cirtcial habitat, and up to 35% disturabnce in matrix habtiat; this is a possible scenario if Canada were to enact an emergency order; assumes all herds protected

no harvest in southern moutnain caribou herd areas; where there is southern moutnain herd boundaries, no harvest; establishes the 'maximum impact' that protection of caribou habitat might potentially have on forest harvest; in Mackenzie TSA these include: Kennedy Siding, Kennedy Siding HESR, Kennedy Siding HEWR, Kennedy Siding LEWR, Kennedy Siding Matrix, Moberly HEWR, Moberly HEWSR, Moberly HESR, Moberly Matrix, Graham HESR, Graham HEWSR, Graham Matrix, Wolverine Herd, Scott Herd, Chase Herd

no harvest in Wolverine/Chaase/Takla herds; to support Central groups  planning, we run a sceanrio with no harvest in the herd boundaries (currently no critical habitat for these herds)


# Mackenzie SW TSA Scenarios
business as usual (BAU); no new constraints, caribou or otherwise; establishes the current 'baseline' or benchmark to evaluate the potential impact of 'new' actions in caribou habitat

no harvest in Wolverine/Chaase/Takla herds; to support Central groups  planning, we run a sceanrio with no harvest in the herd boundaries (currently no critical habitat for these herds)
 
 no harvest in southern moutnain caribou herd areas; where there is southern moutnain herd boundaries, no harvest; establishes the 'maximum impact' that protection of caribou habitat might potentially have on forest harvest; in Mackenzie SW TSA these include: Scott Herd, Wolverine Herd

## 'harvestPriority' parameter 
- focus on minimizing 'disturabnce; for cariobu, then older, higher vlomue stands
  - 'dist, age DESC, vol DESC' priortize based on:
      - 'dist', i.e., distance to disturbed pixel (closest first), then
      - 'age DESC', i.e., descending age (oldest first), then
      - 'vol DESC', i.e., descending volume (highest volume first)

- no discussion of this in PDP or determination that I coudl find

## 'harvestFlow'
The Mackenzie TSA’s allowable annual cut (AAC) was set at 4.5 million cubic metres as of November 14, 2014. A maximum of 2 M m3 is attributable to live uninfested timber and of this 500 000 m3 can be taken from the south west portion of the TSA (see [Rationale for Allowable Annual Cut (AAC) Partition Amendment](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/forestry/stewardship/forest-analysis-inventory/tsr-annual-allowable-cut/16tsra_2019_partition_amendment.pdf)). 

- In the main portion of the TSA, first, I tested a harvest flow of 1,500,000m^3^/year (7,500,000m^3^/5-year); was acheivle, so tried 1.75 M m3, 1.65 M, 1.70 M m3; slight fall down in last 10 years at 1.7, but kept at this number


From 2014 determination: "...current policy already allows stands with less than 150 cubic metres per hectare to be harvested at the licensees’ discretion.  Given the results of the sensitivity analysis in which a decrease in the minimum average volume limit eliminates the projected decline in the base case mid-term timber supply, I strongly encourage Mackenzie Fibre to work with licensees to explore opportunities to harvest lower volume stands in the Mackenzie TSA. With regard to Canfor’s ’ recommendation that an average stand volume limit of 200 cubic metres not be applied in the base case, I note that removal of this limit in a sensitivity analysis resulted in a much higher contribution of low-volume stands than is currently supported by demonstrated harvest performance in the Mackenzie TSA. After careful consideration of all the information available to me, I conclude that the minimum harvest criteria used in the base case reasonably reflect demonstrated harvest performance in the Mackenzie TSA and I will make no adjustments to the base case on this account."

- in TSR, the annual average was 200, allowign for <200, but I used 150 m3/ha as minimum harvest volume, and assesed what the average was *a priori* to make sure I was at ~200; foudn that with a 1.7 Mm3 flow, for 23 of 40 intervals average <200, 17 of 40 years average less than 195, 13 of 40 years less than 190, and 7 of 40 less than 185; so I am overesriamtign use of low voluem stands much of the time, but on average typiecally not more than by 15m3/ha; lowest average was 180 m3; so I kept as is (any major concerns with this?)

For cutblock adjacency, I used 3 m adjacncey; no real mention fo this in report

## Flow Chart

```{r, flow_chart}

eventDiagram(mysimout)
```

## Algorithum

The general algorithum (pseudo-code) follows as:

`compartment_list`= SELECT zones FROM compartments WHERE target > 0 ORDER BY priority_compartment

FOR compartment_selected in `compartment_list`
`queue`<- SELECT pixelid, blockid FROM pixels WHERE 
            compartment = compartment_selected AND thlb > 0 AND constraint = 0                 ORDER BY priority
               
IF (`queue` > 0 )
  check constraints
ELSE 
  NEXT
        

# Data dependencies

## Input data

A SQLite db is required (output from dataloaderCLUS). A harvestFlow data.table object that includes the forest management unit (i.e., compartment, aka - 'supply block'), the partition from which the harvest flow applies (e.x., All dead pine); the year at which the flow applies and the amount of volume.

## Output data

A list of landings || blocks from when they are harvested.

# Links to other modules

dataloaderCLUS is required.
