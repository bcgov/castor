# Overview

The roading module simulates the development of future roads within a landscape object. Based on a user defined set of points or 'landings' the roading module connects these points to the nearest existing road section using one of three possible approaches:
1. A snapping approach that simulates the road as the crow flies;
2. A least cost path that simulates as the wolf runs; and
3. A minimum spanning tree with least cost paths to promote branching

For a comparison on these approaches go [here](https://github.com/bcgov/castor/blob/master/reports/roads/draft-CLUS-roads.md)


# Usage

```{r module_usage}
library(SpaDES.core)
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
source(here::here("R/functions/R_Postgres.R"))

moduleDir <- paste0(here::here(),"/R/SpaDES-modules")
outputDir <- paste0(here::here(),"/R/SpaDES-modules/roadCastor")

times <- list(start = 0, end = 2)
parameters <- list(
  .progress = list(type = NA, interval = NA),
  .globals = list(),
  dataCastor = list(saveCastorDB = TRUE,
                     randomLandscape = list(100,100,0,100,0,100),
                     randomLandscapeZoneConstraint = 
                       data.table(variable = 'age', threshold = 140, type = 'ge', percentage = 20)
                    ),
  blockingCastor = list(blockMethod='pre', 
                      patchZone = 'default',
                      patchVariation = 6),
  roadCastor = list(roadMethod = 'mst'
                  )
  )
modules <- list("dataCastor", "blockingCastor", "roadCastor")
objects <- list(scenario = data.table(name="test", description = "test"))
paths <- list(
  modulePath = moduleDir,
  outputPath = outputDir
)

mySim <- simInit(times = times, params = parameters, modules = modules,
                 objects = objects, paths = paths)
system.time({
  mySimOut<-spades(mySim)
})
#eventDiagram(mySimOut)
