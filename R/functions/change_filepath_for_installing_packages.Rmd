In this short script I outline how to change the library path to one on a local drive. 

Note: This fix is temporary i.e. when you shutdown R the old library path will be restored so you will have to run this script again if you want to change the library path for future package installations
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

.libPaths() # see what the library paths currently are
mypaths<-.libPaths()
# put the path you want the packages to be installed into in the first spot
mypaths<-c("C:/data/localApps/R-4.1.2/library", mypaths)
.libPaths(mypaths)

.libPaths() # check your intended path is the first one in the list

```
